## Motivation
While I am studying part time to become a data scientist, my full-time job is at The Boeing Company. There has recently been a lot of news and media on Boeing surrounding the 737Max crashes

## Notes for Reuse

For this analysis, only accidents for which were NOT an illegal act such as __suicide, sabotage, or terrorism__ were included. For example, 9/11 2001 terrorism fatalies & accidents are not included. Information on acts of __Suicide, Sabotage, or Terrorism on 14 CFR 121 Flights__ are available [elsewhere](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/air-carrier-occurrences-involving-illegal-acts-sabotage-suicide-or-terrorism-1995-through-).   

Data is incomplete for 2015, so only data through 2014 will be utilized. This is because a complete, verified, factual data is released every 5 years by the FAA. The next big release of records will be mid 2020 with a data set only complete through 2019.
