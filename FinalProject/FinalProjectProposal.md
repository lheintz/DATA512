## Motivation

While I am studying part time to become a data scientist, my full-time job is at The Boeing Company. There has recently been a lot of news and media on Boeing surrounding the 737Max crashes. This brings attention to air travel and the safety of air travel. I believe more people than ever are interested in learning more about air travel safety and the history air travel safety. I hope that I can provide some scientific, fact-based, data-based information and conclusions that a niave reader can understand and find value in. I will focus on United States air travel specifically.

I hope to learn about the trends in aviation accidents and fatalies over time. I hope to learn more about correlative factors to relative safety of a flight. I also hope to learn more about the differences in accident and fatality rates between commericial and private aviation in the United States.

## Data

`What dataset do you plan to use, and why? Summarize what is represented in the dataset; Link to the dataset, and specify license/terms of use; Briefly justify why this dataset is relevant to your problem statement; Highlight any possible ethical considerations to using this dataset (and say why or why not).`

> There are multiple data sets that I plan to use in tandem to complete my analysis. The most detailed data set is the FAA Accident & Incident Data System - which contains a detailed record for every single accident and incident from ~1978 to ~2015 (with MM/DD/YYYY available for each) for any type of United States flight (private, commericial, scheduled, unschedule, cargo, passenger). Examples of the relevant fields of data available for each row item are: Local Event Date, Event City, Event State, Event Airport, Event Type, Aircraft Damage, Flight Phase, Aircraft Make, Aircraft Model, Aircraft Series, Operator, Primary Flight Type, Total Fatalities, Total Injuries, PIC Certificate Type, PIC Flight Time Total Hrs, PIC Flight Time Total Make-Model.   
The other data sets are moer roll up riles

## Terms

| Term   | Definition |

## Unknowns & Dependencies

The time series nature of the data used in this projects leads to some unknowns. Specifically because of my lack of experience working with time series data. Not all of the increments of time are the same for each data set (some are more granual than others). This presents a few unknowns on how the data will ultimately be compiled and used.

Additionally, the fact that there are 4 different data sets presents some challenges. They will need to be cleaned and joined together. Again, there are some dependencies on my ability to successfully and accurately join all this data in a limited amount of time (4 weeks). There may be some manual matching and comparison required. Realistically, I may be required to narrow down the scope of my data sets to the time range which all 4 data sets have in common. This is make my overall data set smaller in the end. In addition, I may be forced in some cases to change the granularity of the time series data in order to make my data clear and consistent.

## Notes for Reuse

For this analysis, only accidents for which were NOT an illegal act such as __suicide, sabotage, or terrorism__ were included. For example, 9/11 2001 terrorism fatalies & accidents are not included. Information on acts of __Suicide, Sabotage, or Terrorism on 14 CFR 121 Flights__ are available [elsewhere](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/air-carrier-occurrences-involving-illegal-acts-sabotage-suicide-or-terrorism-1995-through-).   

Data is incomplete for 2015, so only data through 2014 will be utilized. This is because a complete, verified, factual data is released every 5 years by the FAA. The next big release of records will be mid 2020 with a data set only complete through 2019.
